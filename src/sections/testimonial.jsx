             Social Sciences, aside from the fact that he delivered to time lag,
             the website is professional and responsive to the request of
             intending authors. Publishing with the Journal is easier as
             procedures for uploading a manuscript for consideration for
             publication is made self explanatory by the responsive website
             developed by John. Without any reservation, I recommend for those
             that will require his services now and in the future"`,
